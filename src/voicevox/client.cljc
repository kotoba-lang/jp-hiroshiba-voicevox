  "Portable core for talking to a VOICEVOX Engine
  (https://github.com/VOICEVOX/voicevox_engine, by Hiroshiba Kazuyuki --
  hence this repo's `jp-hiroshiba-voicevox` name) HTTP server: the 2-step
  `POST /audio_query` then `POST /synthesis` flow every VOICEVOX client
  needs, plus one injectable HTTP boundary.

  Ported from `ai-gftd-project-yukkuri`'s `lg/lg_yukkuri/voicevox_client.py`
  (env vars, endpoint shape) and its already-`.cljc`-ported sibling
  `yukkuri.voicevox` (style_id catalog / emotion table / resolve-style-id --
  see `voicevox.speakers` in this repo), which deliberately left the real
  HTTP execution as a `:todo` plan (`ai-gftd-yukkuri/clj/README.md`'s
  no-external-IO design). This repo is that real execution, so any project
  in this ecosystem gets one tested VOICEVOX client instead of re-deriving
  the audio_query/synthesis dance per project.

  Query/response shaping is pure `.cljc`. The actual HTTP call is JVM-only
  by default (`java.net.http`) but every function takes an injectable
  `:http-fn` (`{:url :method :headers :body} -> {:status :body}`, the same
  convention `kotoba-lang/com-cloudflare`/`kotoba-lang/com-youtube` use) --
  `:body` may be a String (JSON) or absent; synthesis responses are raw WAV
  bytes, returned as a byte[] rather than routed through the JSON codec."
